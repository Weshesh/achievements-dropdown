Task:

design:


What needs to be done:
1. Implement settings button that shows selected company name.
2. When the button is clicked then open the dropdown.
3. Following things can be done in the dropdown:

2. The implementation looks very close to the given design
3. JavaScript code is properly covered with unit tests
4. You would be proud of the code quality of the mini-project yourself
